## Story Behind Making This
This all started as a joke with my aunt about how hard it was to evenly slice a Vasilopita evenly between 20 people. If you don't know the tradition behind the Vasilopita you might not know what it's so important for it to be evenly sliced. 

Vasilopita is a traditional Greek cake or bread baked on January 1st, which is New Year's Day, to celebrate St. Basil's Day. St. Basil was a fourth-century bishop known for his generosity to the poor. The tradition is associated with a story where St. Basil wanted to distribute money to the poor people in his community but faced resistance from those who felt embarrassed to accept charity. To solve this, he baked coins into bread loaves, which were then distributed.

Today, the tradition continues where a coin is hidden inside the vasilopita, and the person who finds it is believed to have good luck for the coming year. The vasilopita is usually cut by the head of the household, and the pieces are distributed to family members and guests in a particular order, often beginning with the eldest member of the family. It's a joyful tradition that brings families and communities together to celebrate the New Year and remember the spirit of generosity and goodwill associated with St. Basil.
